        [h1]Beef's SEGI Plus[/h1]
        [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersLaunchPad Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.
        See: https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad

        There is an in-game config menu with F11.

        A modified version of SEGI (Sonic Ether Global Illumination) for Stationeers with shader fixes and performance options.

        - 4 quality presets (Low/Medium/High/Extreme)
        - Lightweight Mode that voxelizes only emissive objects for maximum performance at the cost of more light leakage
        > This lightweight mode is independent from the quality preset, so can be enabled/disabled to find the best balance for you
        - Automatic day/night ambient lighting that adjusts based on sun position
        - Modified SEGI shaders to work properly with Stationeers rendering

        Built upon the work of
        Sonic Ether (original SEGI): https://github.com/sonicether/SEGI
        Erdroy (initial Stationeers port): https://github.com/Erdroy/Stationeers.SEGI
        and Vinus (previous implementation): https://github.com/TerameTechYT/StationeersSharp/tree/development/Source/SEGIMod

        Configuration available through F11 in-game menu, StationeersLaunchPad config, or BepInEx config files.

    <ChangeLog>
        1.2.0:
        - Added first pass of adaptive framerate control that works with the quality setting to try and improve performance
        - This can be used at any quality setting and with or without lightweight mode
        - This isn't automatically enabled as it's yet experimental - you can enable this in settings

        1.1.1:
        - Improved lightweight mode cleanup
        - I inverted the new sun calc like a big dumb

        1.1.0:
        - Added more info to the F11 menu to help with understanding settings
        - Fixed F11 menu breaking when returning or used in main menu/splash screens
        - Added F11 menu scaling so it is bigger at 1440/4k
        - Better day/night transition (now transitions between 2-10 degrees sun elevation instead of +5/-5 deg)
        - Added Advanced Furnace to object exclusion list in lightweight mode
        - Thanks **BassManDan** for your feedback helping get this update done quickly

        1.0.0:
        - Updated plugin architecture
        - Added lightweight rendering with cached object culling by layer/emissiveness
        - Implemented quality preset sliders
        - Improved scene management
        - Day/Night diffuse light adjustments
        - Updated SEGI Shaders to play more nicely with stationeers
        - Improved layer culling for regular rendering
        - Updated config menu system
